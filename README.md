School dropout rates in Canada, a developed nation, remain a pressing concern.
Numerous factors contribute to this issue, and our study aims to investigate these underlying causes. 

By analyzing various influential factors, we seek to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting student dropout.

This predictive capability will equip educational authorities with valuable insights, enabling them to implement targeted interventions and address the root causes of dropout, ultimately improving educational outcomes and fostering a more equitable society.
